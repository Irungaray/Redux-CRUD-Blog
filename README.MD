# The JSON-Placeholder CRUD Blog

Fetching the JSON-Placeholder API and rendering its data into two principal sections: Users and Works.

**Users** shows dummy users, and each user's dummy posts.
**Works** shows dummy tasks assigned to the users, which you can virtually edit or delete.

Hope you Enjoy!
